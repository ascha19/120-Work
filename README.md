#This Week's Summary

I read through the new information to incorporate it and last week's info into this week's homework piece. At first, I was going to make a stick figure cursor with another stick figure dancing in the background on the canvas, but when I messed up on the stick figure's body I came up with the new idea of making what I'm calling "Really Weird Space". I spent way too much time messing around with the cursor, which I can't decide is a star or a planet but I've dubbed it Starboi. After working with that, I worked on how to make my canvas color change and how to add and translate the stars, which took a while. There's probably a much easier way to do the stars than how I did them but I was just having fun.

##Problems and Issues
I didn't really have many issues this week, aside from messing up Stickboi's body, thus turning him into Starboi. I also struggled a bit figuring out how to make the background change and how to make the stars properly, but messing around and checking the P5 references helped me work those things out.

I'm also not sure if I'm uploading this assignment on time, or if I did this assignment too early. I thought week five started this Thursday but my Moodle never updated and I couldn't find anything on the subject, so I just decided to do the assignment just in case.

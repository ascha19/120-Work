# This Week's Summary

## The Process
I followed the videos and prompts of making the third homework folder, working with the empty example file, updating the repo on Github, and making my Github Pages site live. When dealing with the ellipses and draw commands, I played around with the circle's proportions and the canvas colors. For the most part, I simply followed the directions given to me, but I did enjoy playing around with the ellipses, text, canvas colors, etc. I'm really enjoying the in-browser views of the coding we've been working on, and I'm excited to see what else I'll get to see via it as the class continues.

## Problems and Issues
The only problem I really came across was when I couldn't get my github.io link to work. I checked my spelling, capitalization, etc, reread the prompts, and even searched similar issues on Github but I couldn't find an answer to my problem. Eventually, I had to write an issue myself in hopes of figuring out the problem. I didn't receive any solutions through my issue either, so I created a new repository altogether and moved my existing files to it; this seemed to sort things out but hopefully this issue won't pop up again. 

Despite my own problems, in the previous homework cycle I helped a fellow classmate figure out a link they were typing out wrong.

# This Week's Summary

## The Process
I read my way through the information and browsed the extra materials provided. The radians video is no longer available, so I had to make do with the othr knowledge given to me. Instead of making a self-portrait, I made a monster-portrait. I decided to recreate a picture of the Marvel antihero Venom that I found; though he's technically not a monster, he could be considered as one.

The image I attempted to recreate:

## Problems and issues
I had very few issues this time. It was mainly a struggle of deciding where to start and then figuring out where the next pieces should go after creating the first one. My biggest issue was figuring out how to create Venom's mouth, mainly figuring out which coordinates gave me the mouth shape I wanted to create.

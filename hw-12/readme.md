# This Week's Summary

## The Process
I wanted to do something chill and more or less simple this week, so I took one of the example codes and altered it. The orginal idea was balls bouncing against each other and changing colors as they do so. My idea was to skip the bouncing part and see if the colors would still change just by passing through each other. I altered the code to my liking, dissecting it a bit in the process, and that was that. My least favorite thing is probably that the now bubbles turn gray when passing through each other but other than that I think everything worked out well.

I'd actually had a more complex mini game idea at first, but I'd forgotten it until I'd almost finished this project and, already spending more time on this piece than I meant to, I just decided to finish what I had.

## Issues and Problems
The only issue I really had was making the bubbles appear again. It took a little dissecting of the example code and several edits and debugs of my own code, but I eventually figured out that it was little details such as misspellings and a missing bracket.

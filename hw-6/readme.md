# This Week's Summary

Math is my least favorite thing--ironic, considering this a coding class--so I wasn't too excited for this week's assignment. I had a lot of ideas but they ended up dwindling as this week's stresses went on, so the result is a mess of practice coding. I went throw all the reading for the week, checked out many reference pages on the p5 website, and took codes from both resources to alter and practice the given prompts.

## Problems and Issues

I didn't suffer to bad, aside from trying to remember with functions did what. Had some issues figuring out and changing colors for the background and jittery circle, which I call Roundboi, but the end result was a cool black-to-red concept that reminded me of a scene out of a book I'm reading where the skies and sun are red. My main issue was not the assignment itself but my personal stuff that got in the way of me enjoying this week's assignment.

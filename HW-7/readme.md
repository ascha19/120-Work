# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

<!--
The ball is bouncing around the canvas in what I would call a lattice formation, leaving a trail in its wake.

The first ten lines are variables created inside a map function for easier use. The first of these variables establishes the ball's width, the next two establishing its x and y values, and the variables made to later help establish the ball's movement pattern. Lines 12 through 14 create the canvas and background for the sketch, making the canvas (windowWidth, 400) and the background white.

Line 19 starts the draw sketch, followed by lines 21 through 30 determining the ball's positions of movement via the if function. Lines 32 and 33 draw the ball and color it white. Line 36 starts a new function to create a change via the mouse's click, with the lines explaining the ball's movement's changes in the two lines after that.

## How did you alter the sketch?

<!--
I simply changed the ball's movement pattern by altering the variables on lines 21, 22, 26, 29, 37, and 38. I also changed the x and y variables, and the ball's size.Finally the changed the background to a light gray and changed the ball's color to black because the black line was more appealing to me and it was pleasant to watch the black eventually totally cover the gray canvas.

# This Week's Summary

## The Process

I've already written this twice so bear me; my computer is crap and my program keeps freezing.

My plan for this week's assignment was to make a dumb joke while utilizing arrays and functions as per the instructions. I made an array for the response to the joke/phrase with a text function to display it. Then I created simple images which I had hoped I could get to appear when their corresponding words did, and perhaps even float around the canvas or follow the mouse. However, try as I might, I couldn't figure out a solution to my problem of the images appearing and changing; at least I still fulfil most of the requirements.

## Problems and Issues

My biggest issue was probably making the code at all. I posted an issue and got help, but even after fixing the code it took moving the code to a new file to make it run. After that, most things ran smoothly until I wanted to make the images appear and disappear according to their corresponding word that appeared in the text. I attempted if functions and mousPressed to no avail; my attempts either resulted in the code breaking, all images still being visible the entire time, or one image being visible at all times while the others weren't. Unfortunately, the past two weeks were hectic as is and I ran out of time and ideas.

# This Week's Summary

## The Process
For the first part of this week's assignment, I took one of my favorite assignments, a simple sketch doodle of Marvel's Venom, and altered it. First of all, I cleaned up the new file's notes to be just simple enough to know what's going on, then spaced out the sections so it wasn't one big wall of text. For the actual assignment, I turned the entire drawing of Denom (the name this sketch's Venom has lovingly earned) into it's own function. Along with that, I added another function ("tongue") that I ended up not using, the mousePressed function, and an array. Using the mousePressed function I created an action where Denom winks. At the same time, a headline with Denom's name and the catchphrase he's gained appears in the top left corner, and various words with appear in random colors if you keep clicking. These words are contained within the array I mentioned earlier.

## Issues and Problems
I think my biggest issue starting out was just getting this sketch to work at all. I'd started it late at night and apparently late-night me forgot a lot of semicolons and end brackets. I posted my problem in the issues forum and a fellow classmate helped me find and change them. From there, it was just a matter of me deciding what I wnated to do with the sketch and how to execute that. I had several ideas, including making Denom dance, blink, have his tongue unfurl, and have his legs disappear while he floats around the screen. Through trial and error, and because I thought the idea was silly and cute when it came to mind, I settled on Denom winking and decided to use the array (which I'd no ideas for before then) to make words appear.

# This Week's Summary

I read and watched all the materials given for the week. I was inspired by one of the provided example codes to make it look like a flashing construction sign, or at least similar, and then another of the codes to create a club or disco-feeling background; this those things in mind, I took the two codes and altered them. I was also going to attempt to make a house with flickering windows, as if the other two loops represented the party that was happening inside, but with the code was already bogged down by the loops already written and I didn't want to go overboard and cause a crash or something. This may have just been because of my computer but I didn't want to risk it regardless.

The main edit I made to the sample codes was to add color, specifically flashing color. I went with a white to black gradient using the random() function for the background, which I felt was reminiscent of a disco ball, and a red to yellow gradient to the "arrows". Other edits mainly indluded altering the calculations to better fit my idea.

## Problems and Issues

I didn't have many issues this time, luckily. It was mainly a lot of playing around and altering bits of code until I got what I wanted. I think the biggest issue I had was with the yellow arrows, which I was hoping to make simply flashing yellow or a yellow to yellow-orange gradient, but the end result was yellow to red instead.

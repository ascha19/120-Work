# This Week's Summary

## The Process

I read and watched all the materials given for this week's assignment. I based my code off the sample codes given by both Shiffman and Professor Musick as well as a sample code I found on the p5.js site. Originally, I came up wit hthe idea of making a sketch resembling cheese, with the holes in the cheese being made from a class and vibrating for no paricular reason. However, that eventually changed after I played around with colors more and resulted in a sketch with a space aesthetic, with the stars/planets changing colors and flying off the screen. I used a class to make the space-stuffs and their movement and color shifting, and then popped the class into an array so everything would actually work. It took me a while to fully get things figured out but I'm happy with the result.

## Problems and Issues

The main problem I had with this week, similar to last week, was making the moving objects appear. I tried several different methods and reorganizing to make things work but to no avail. Finally, I decided I would take one of the three working sample codes I'd based mine off of, paste into a different sketch, and dissect it alongside my own code to see what I was missing. I eventually found out that I had changed 'this.speed' in my own sketch to 'this.movement,' which resulted in bits of the code not appearing. After fixing that error and messing around with coloring a bit more, I finished with a piece I actually liked.

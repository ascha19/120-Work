# Spring 2019 Semester Final Proposal
#### April 14, 2019

## The Subject
For my final, I wanted to create something practical and useful that would give me a bit of a challenge. At first, I settled on a notepad/text editor concept but while researching the subject, I couldn't find decent references that also fit the final's guidelines. After that, I decided to create a to-do list of sorts instead, utlizing JavaScript, but also working with HTML and CSS.

## Related Work and Inspiration
I didn't have any particular inspiration for this idea; I just knew that I wanted to create something that people could actually use if they wanted to. While researching, I found a couple sites that were very useful in helping me orient myself with the idea, one of them being The Odin Project. I also regularly use to-do lists in my daily life, some apps including Habitica, Done, Any.do, and Todoist; the last two were actually suggested as references by The Odin Project when addressing to do lists.

## Possible Problems
I expect my biggest issues will revolve around using concepts I'm not super familiar with, such as HTML and CSS. Other than that, I think it'll such be a matter of figuring out how things work and making them do so. These past couple weeks I noticed that I make small mistakes that prevent things from appearing or functioning properly on occasion, so that's something I need to focus on.

## The Plan
I don't exactly have a daily plan, as I don't want working on my coding final to conflict with my other classes. That being said, I plan on splitting the execution into sections, allowing myself one or two days (one idealy, two at most) to work on each section with the intial research and debugging towards the end to have a little extra time.

## Completed Work So Far
At the moment, the majority of what I've done so far is research references of to-do list apps and to-do list coding exmaples to familiarize myself with the concept; I've also taken some of these codes and dissected them, altered them, etc to figure out how they work, with my end goal of being able to create and execute my own version of said codes. Other than that, I've prepared the needed files for the final and tested around a few different ideas.
